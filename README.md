# COVID-AR
Application to analyze COVID-19 evolution of cases, based in .csv files

## About this project

COVID-AR is an application built with Kivy and KivyMD frameworks in Python. The original purpose of this app was to create an easy-to-use tool to make basic statistical plots like Barplots and Lineplots to analyze COVID-19 cases based in .csv datasets. Also, it makes use of the Seaborn library to visualizate data.

Although the intention behind this project was originally to make visualizations of COVID-19 cases, it can be used for anything related to bar and line plots.
